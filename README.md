# Bacterial_RNAseq_analysis
This bacterial-RNAseq analysis pipeline is based on four main steps: (a) reads alignment and quality filtering; 
(b) alignment visualization; (c) gene counts production; and (d) gene counts normalization and differential expression analysis.
We embedded in the analysis workflow five checkpoints regarding:(1) the evaluation of sequencing performances; (2) the calculation of genome alignment levels; (3) the estimation of the quality of the library (adapter presence, rRNA removal, and strand specificity); (4) the assessment of global gene coverage; and (5) the control of sample reproducibility.

The following code is part of the book "Metabolic Network Reconstruction and Modeling: Methods and Protocols", chapter 11 "RNA Sequencing and Analysis in Microrganisms for Metabolic Network Reconstruction".
